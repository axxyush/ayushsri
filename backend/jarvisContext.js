  about:
    "I’m Ayush Srivastava, a UB Computer Science major who wrangles full-stack apps by day and racks up killstreaks in Call of Duty by night, usually with a superhero movie queued up for halftime. In my student-assistant position I’ve transformed clunky IT workflows into smooth, user-friendly web app, and I love swapping debugging war stories over coffee. Whether I’m architecting an AI meeting sidekick or debating which Spiderman suit looks best, I bring solid technical chops, a collaborative spirit, and just enough dry wit to keep the team smiling. If you need someone who can ship reliable code and still land the winning headshot then let’s connect!",
